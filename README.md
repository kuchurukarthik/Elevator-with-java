# Elevator-with-java
This project is to develop an elevator system without using a database.
Code might be bit long but it can be shortened if methods are used in few cases.
You can select enter elevator option from any floor and select any floor that you want to go to.
In this program floors are limited from 0 to 5, where 0 stands for ground floor.
Sleep() is used to indicate the user the current status of elevator.
